# 371GPT Solopreneur Guide

This guide is specifically tailored for solopreneurs who want to run and customize 371GPT for their own business needs.

## Getting Started as a Solopreneur

As a solopreneur, you'll likely want:
1. Quick setup with minimal overhead
2. Cost-effective deployment
3. Customization for your specific business needs
4. Ability to run locally or on minimal cloud infrastructure

## Local Development Setup

### Minimal Setup for Testing

```powershell
# Create a test pod
podman pod create --name 371gpt-solo -p 8000:8000

# Run the key services
podman run -d --pod 371gpt-solo --name postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=solo -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=solopass -e POSTGRES_DB=solodb postgres:15-alpine

# Build and run UI
podman build -t 371gpt-ui ./services/ui
podman run -d --pod 371gpt-solo --name ui -e JWT_SECRET=solo-secret 371gpt-ui
```

## Customizing for Your Business

### 1. Agent Configuration

Edit `config/agents/agent-config.json` to:
- Focus on agents relevant to your business
- Remove unnecessary capabilities
- Add custom prompts specific to your industry

Example for a marketing solopreneur:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "marketing_agent",
      "description": "Creates marketing copy and analyzes campaigns",
      "capabilities": ["content_generation", "analytics"],
      "memory_size": 20,
      "prompts": {
        "content_generation": "Create engaging marketing copy for {product} targeting {audience}...",
        "analytics": "Analyze the performance of {campaign} based on {metrics}..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. UI Customization

Modify `config/ui/ui-config.json` to:
- Brand the UI with your company colors
- Show only the features you need
- Set up custom dashboards for your workflow

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "primary": "#YOUR_BRAND_COLOR",
    "secondary": "#YOUR_SECONDARY_COLOR",
    "dark_mode": true
  },
  "branding": {
    "company_name": "Your Company Name",
    "logo_url": "https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png"
  },
  "dashboard": {
    "default_view": "marketing",
    "custom_views": [
      {
        "name": "marketing",
        "widgets": ["campaign_stats", "content_calendar", "lead_generation"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Cost-Effective Deployment Options

### 1. Local Machine

Run everything on your local machine:
- Zero cloud costs
- Complete privacy of data
- Offline capability

### 2. Minimal VPS

Deploy to a small VPS:
- Digital Ocean ($5-$10/month)
- Linode ($5-$10/month)
- AWS Lightsail ($3.50-$10/month)

```bash
# Setup on VPS
ssh your-vps
git clone https://github.com/ab1355/371GPT.git
cd 371GPT
./run-with-podman.sh
```

### 3. Serverless Functions for Cost Optimization

For intermittent usage, consider:
- Keep database always on (minimal tier)
- Use serverless functions for agents (pay per execution)
- Deploy UI as a static site with API connections

## Integration with Solopreneur Tools

### 1. CRM Integration

Add connections to common CRM tools:
- HubSpot
- Pipedrive
- Zoho CRM

Example in `services/agents/crm_agent.py`:

```python
async def sync_with_crm(self, crm_type, api_key):
    if crm_type == "hubspot":
        # Code to sync with HubSpot
        pass
    elif crm_type == "pipedrive":
        # Code to sync with Pipedrive
        pass
```

### 2. Email Marketing

Connect with email platforms:
- Mailchimp
- ConvertKit
- SendGrid

### 3. Social Media Scheduling

Add capabilities for:
- Buffer
- Hootsuite
- Later

## Backup Strategy for Solopreneurs

   podman exec postgres pg_dump -U solo solodb > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   ```

2. **Configuration Backups**:
   - Store configs in a private GitHub repository
   - Use git versioning for tracking changes
